## Description

Tinder-alike (demo name) is a project to showcase my potential in developing a Fullstack Application as I improve my Development abilities!

- The application will be improved after the initial deployment to include more features and usability, but is in no way designed to generate income and is a self-created project for study/demos

Both Frontend and Backend are properly deployed and correctly talking with each other


## Deployment

Deployment link (using Firebase): [https://tinder-alike-6cbd3.web.app/](https://tinder-alike-6cbd3.web.app/)

After the initial deployment, the applicaiton will be improved with menu functionality, larger databases, increases funcitonality (so that data shown is not always in the same order), as well as databases added for storing favorited people/cards
